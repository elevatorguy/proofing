# KITARON 72-312 Mono Audio Amp

I came across this board board inside a 1982 USI Pi4 CRT that was what looked like an after-market hobbiest mod.

This was documented in [this video](https://youtube.com/@polymatt).

It was a push/pull AB low power audio amp using germanium transistors, diodes and all discrete components. Unfortrunately, all of the transistors and transforers had failed and I was unable to find drop-in replacements.

I decided to remove the components, scan the board, and take a swing at laying out the schematic based on what was originally on the board in hope that someone would find it useful in the future.
